+ added mus21 play util function
_ is there a way to test this?

+ removed tuplet+dotted test. canon usage: no dotted notes inside tuplets
_ need to document and/or create exception for this


+ started Note, a module for notes in a composition (pitch + length)
+ add use of attrs library
+ use getattr to dispatch note.x to note.attributes.x, note.pitch.x note.length.x

_ clean up getattr dispatch to go where it actually needs to (way to combine pitch + length into single DRY dispatch)
_ need to change TonalVector.note to something like pitch_name, to minimize confusion
